Client - The user's computer that a web application is running on. It typically
gets all of the data from the server (the source code necessary for the app) and
typically compiles the code. It can also make requests to the server for 
authentication, authorization, and to send data back and forth as necessary. 


Server - Where I think the API lives, based on what endpoint the Client calls
will send and recieve data and process it. It also sends the client a response
(whether the request was a GET, POST, or etc) with the data or with any errors
that occur. Can also save and fetch data from a database and pass it on to the
client. 

Frontend - What runs on the client and what the user directly interacts with.
For example an app built using Angular.

Backend - The database and the server - what the user doesn't see but their 
computer still interacts with.
