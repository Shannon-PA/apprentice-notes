AUTH: authentication is a form of security that allows people to gain access to a service like a normal
 user by using something to authenticate who the person is for example ways of authenticating 
 a person can be used by username/password, cookies, and something called JSON web tokens. JSON
 web tokens are most commonly used these days for single sign on applications such as pinnacol wiki.
 The JWT's are used in authorization by allowing a certain amount of services and resources specific to
 the person that the JWT is connected to based on their identity. for example a regular user will be authorized to have limited access 
 to routes and services compared to someone who is a admin who will be authorized to have a high access to 
 routes and services. The difference between authentication and authorization is that authentication  
 AUTH is important because this does not allow anyone to simply act as a different person to steal or realease any personal information
