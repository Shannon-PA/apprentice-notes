# myTestRepo
This is a test repo

Some commands for you:

`git clone <url>`

This duplicates a repo from github onto your computer. You'll find the (cloned) repo under a folder with the name of the project, eg 'myTestRepo'
---
`git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`

This command creates a new branch locally for you to work in and make changes. Changes you make in this branch won't affect other branches assuming you `commit` to the branch (that's a command - not an encouragement)

---
`git add -A`

'Stages' all changes you've made and gets the ready to commit. You can remove or add some files at this stage, so you don't have to commit all the files. the '-A' flag adds all files to staging.

---
`git commit -m "My commit message. Dominic needs to git gud boi"`

This 'commits' the changes you made to your branch. It's now safe to switch branches and you can push your branch back up to github so other people can see it.

---
`git push --setupstream origin <branch_name>`

This 'pushes' the changes you've just staged to github itself.
